# Gold-spike-QM-MM
Structure and input files to run QM/MM simulations of a gold surface and protein in GROMACS-CP2K
- Au-spike: The system is a AU slab and the spike protein. GROMACS input file to run un unbiased MD simulation.
- Au-fragment: The system is a AU slab and a fragment of the spike protein (residues 480-488). GROMACS and CP2K input files to run a QM/MM MD simulation.
